# Spring Boot Java applications for CICS, Part 4: JDBC


## Learning Objectives
Accessing a relational database from your Springboot application is likely to be an essential requirement for your application. This tutorial demonstrates how to create a Java application which accesses a relational database using Spring Boot's approach to JDBC. The application is designed to be deployed into a Liberty server, running in CICS. 

Spring Boot's JDBC support provides database related beans, such as `JdbcTemplate` and `DataSource`. These beans can be auto-wired into an application to facilitate an automatic JDBC connection to your database. Follow the steps in this article to create a Spring Boot web application that reads and updates the Db2 employee table. The application is designed to be built using Gradle or Maven, and deployed in a CICS Liberty JVM server using IBM Db2® for z/OS as the relational database. 

This tutorial will show you how to

1. Create and build a Spring Boot application that uses JDBC
1. Access the data base using Spring's `JdbcTemplate` 
1. Use a `DataSource` bean as an alternative way of locating the dataSource reference.
1. Understand how to make JDBC updates transactional in CICS
1. Test the sample in CICS

The application is a web application where all requests can be made from a browser. The application uses the Spring Boot web interface to process GET REST requests. In a real world implementation of this other types of REST interfaces, such as POST, would be more appropriate. GET requests are used here for simplicity.

The application source and build scripts are available in the [cicsdev/cics-java-liberty-springboot-jdbc](https://github.com/cicsdev/cics-java-liberty-springboot-jdbc/) repository.


## Prerequisites

- CICS TS V5.3 or later
- A configured Liberty JVM server in CICS
- Db2 for z/OS (or another relational database)
- Java SE 1.8 on the z/OS system
- Java SE 1.8 on the workstation
- An Eclipse development environment on the workstation
- Either Gradle or Apache Maven on the workstation

## Estimated time

It should take you about 2 hours to complete this tutorial.


## Step 1: Create the Application

You can develop the code by following this tutorial step-by-step, or by downloading the [cics-java-liberty-springboot-jdbc](https://github.com/cicsdev/cics-java-liberty-springboot-jdbc) example in GitHub.

If you are following step-by-step, generate and download a Spring Boot web application using the Spring initializr website tool. For further details on how to do this, refer to part 1 of this tutorial series [Spring Boot Java applications for CICS, Part 1: JCICS, Gradle, and Maven](https://developer.ibm.com/technologies/java/tutorials/spring-boot-java-applications-for-cics-part-1-jcics-maven-gradle). We use Eclipse as our preferred IDE.

Once your newly generated project has been imported into your IDE, you should have the `Application.java` and `ServletInitializer.java` classes which provide the basic framework of a Spring Boot web application.  

In the first part of this tutorial series we looked in-depth at how to use Gradle or Maven to build a Spring Boot web application for CICS. Using that knowledge you should now be in a position to enhance the `build.gradle`, or `pom.xml` to include the necessary dependencies to compile against the additinal Spring Boot libraries. In particular we require the libraries that provide the Spring JDBC and Spring Transaction support. If you also need to use the JCICS API within your application to invoke CICS commands, you will need to add further dependencies to your build as outlined in the previous tutorial.

For Gradle, your build file should have the additional following dependencies:

```gradle
    implementation("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-data-jdbc")
    implementation ("org.springframework:spring-tx")     
 ```

For Maven, you'll need the following additonal dependencies in your `pom.xml`
```xml 
<dependency>
      <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-jdbc</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
      <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-tx</artifactId>
</dependency>
```


## Step 2. Access the relational data base.
In this section we will describe how to access the data base using Spring's `JdbcTemplate`.

### Add a class to define the data object(s)

This example application makes use of a supplied Db2 table which contains employee data. The supplied table can be found on your Db2 for z/OS system in database DSN8D11A. The DDL for this table can be found in the [Db2 for z/OS Knowledge Center](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEPEK_11.0.0/intro/src/tpc/db2z_sampletablesemployeemain.html)

We need to have a representation of this table in our application so the first item we add is a definition of the employee object. This is provided in our sample [`Employee.java`](https://github.com/cicsdev/cics-java-liberty-springboot-jdbc/blob/master/src/main/java/com/ibm/cicsdev/springboot/jdbc/Employee.java) class. This is a standard Java representation of our employee record which contains definitions for each column in the table, a constructor plus getters and setters for each field.

### Add a REST controller

The REST controller is the code which will process the requests coming in from the browser. It will direct the incoming requests to the appropriate service methods to complete the request. Code for [EmployeeRestController.java](https://github.com/cicsdev/cics-java-liberty-springboot-jdbc/blob/master/src/main/java/com/ibm/cicsdev/springboot/jdbc/EmployeeRestController.java) is provided in the sample. The controller contains endpoints to perform the following functions:

* Simple end point to display usage information
* Display all Employees in the table
* Display one Employee in the table
* Add a new row (Employee) to the table
* Delete a row (Employee) from the table
* Update a row (Employee) in the table
* Add a new row (Employee) to the table under an XA transaction
* Delete a row (Employee) from the table under an XA transaction
* Update row (Employee) in the table under an XA transaction


The root endpoint providing usage details looks like the following: 

```java  
	/**
	 * Simple endpoint - returns date and time - simple test of the application
	 * 
	 * @return  a Hello message 
	 */
	@GetMapping("/")
	@ResponseBody
	public String Index()
	{    
		Date myDate = new Date();
		SimpleDateFormat sdf = new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MM-dd:HH-mm-ss.SSSSSS");
		String myDateString = sdf.format(myDate);
		
		return "<h1>Spring Boot JDBC Employee REST sample. Date/Time: " + myDateString + "</h1>"
        + "<h3>Usage:</h3>"
        + "<b>/allEmployees</b> - return a list of employees using a classic SELECT statement <br>"
        + "<b>/listEmployee/{empno}</b> - a list of employee records for the employee number provided <br>"
        + "<br> --- Update operations --- <br>"
        + "<b>/addEmployee/{firstName}/{lastName}</b> - add an employee <br>"               
        + "<b>/deleteEmployee/{empNo}</b> - delete an employee <br>"
        + "<b>/updateEmployee/{empNo}/{newSalary}</b> - update employee salary <br>"
        + "<br> --- Update operations within a Global (XA) Transaction --- <br>"
        + "<b>/addEmployeeTx/{firstName}/{lastName}</b> - add an employee using an XA transaction <br>"             
        + "<b>/deleteEmployeeTx/{empNo}</b> - delete an employee using an XA transaction <br>"
        + "<b>/updateEmployeeTx/{empNo}/{newSalary}</b> - update employee salary using an XA transaction";
	}
```

### Add service class using Spring's `JdbcTemplate`

The REST controller contains an `@Autowired` annotation for our employee service.

```java
@Autowired  
private EmployeeService employeeService;
```
This enables the controller to call methods which service the incoming requests. This service class makes calls to the database using the `JdbcTemplate` class supplied by Spring. It also calls the dao(data access object) class to construct an object representation of the EMP table row. 

`JdbcTemplate` is the central class in Spring's JDBC core package. It simplifies the use of JDBC and helps to avoid common errors. `JdbcTemplate` executes core JDBC workflow, leaving application code to provide the SQL and extract results. The class also executes SQL queries or updates, initiates iteration over ResultSets, catches JDBC exceptions and translates them to the generic, more informative exception hierarchy defined in the `org.springframework.dao package`. In addition when you don't have a Spring managed transaction then the `JdbcTemplate `will also call the `close()` method on the data source Connection to ensure connections are returned to the pool.

Our example application uses the query and update methods of JdbcTemplate class. In each case JdbcTemplate is passed a piece of SQL as a string and any result sets are processed by JdbcTemplate and returned in the appropriate object. In the case of the queries using the update method the JdbcTemplate.update returns an integer indicating the number of rows which have been affected by the update. 
 
The service class for this application `EmployeeService.java` can be viewed [here](https://github.com/cicsdev/cics-java-liberty-springboot-jdbc/blob/master/src/main/java/com/ibm/cicsdev/springboot/jdbc/EmployeeService.java) in the sample application.

The following snippet of code shows the `JdbcTemplate` being used to query all rows in the employee table

```java
    public List<Employee> selectAll() throws NamingException 
    {
        // setup the select SQL
        String sql = "SELECT * FROM emp";

        // run the query
        return jdbcTemplate.query(
                sql,
                (rs, rowNum) ->
                new Employee(
                        rs.getString("EMPNO"),
                        rs.getString("FIRSTNME"),
                        rs.getString("MIDINIT"),
                        rs.getString("LASTNAME"),
                        rs.getString("WORKDEPT"),
                        rs.getString("PHONENO"),
                        rs.getDate("HIREDATE"),
                        rs.getString("JOB"),
                        rs.getInt("EDLEVEL"),
                        rs.getString("SEX"),
                        rs.getString("BIRTHDATE"),
                        rs.getLong("SALARY"),
                        rs.getLong("BONUS"),
                        rs.getLong("COMM")));
    }
```

### Configure application.properties
Next in the `src/main/resources` folder create an `application.properties` file to contain the following property. The value should match exactly the JNDI name which will be specified in the data source definition which we will add to our Liberty `server.xml` later in this tutorial. This enables the JdbcTemplate to locate the JNDI reference for the required data source.
```
spring.datasource.jndi-name=jdbc/jdbcDataSource
```

## Step 3. Using a DataSource bean to locate the data source
Instead of using the `spring.datasource.jndi-name` property to name the JNDI reference for the data source, the JNDI name can alternatively be set using a DataSource bean within the application. To do this, the `Application` class would need to provide a method annotated with the `@Bean` annotation that lookups up the data source using the JNDI method `InitialContext.doLookup()` and supplies this as a return value. 

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class Application {
    private static final String DATA_SOURCE = "jdbc/jdbcDataSource";

    public static void main(String args[]) throws NamingException {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }

    @Bean
    public static DataSource dataSource() {
        try {
            DataSource ds = InitialContext.doLookup(DATA_SOURCE);
            return ds;
        } catch (NamingException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
            return null;
        }
    }
}
```

Then in the `EmployeeService` class the bean must be auto-wired as follows:
```java
@Autowired
private DataSource myDatasource
```
This method removes the ability to easily modify the JNDI reference using the property, so is not used in our supplied example.

> **Note:** If your application needs to access multiple data sources then...... 
A working example for this technique is provided in the CICSDev git repository[cics-java-liberty-springboot-jdbc-multi](https://github.com/cicsdev/cics-java-liberty-springboot-jdbc-multi).

## Step 4. Add transaction support

Transactional support is a key part of using JDBC within CICS. Our sample can be used either within the default transactional scope of a CICS unit-of-work, or within the scope of global 
transaction by using the REST endpoints prefixed with `Tx` such as `addEmployeeTx/{firstName}/{lastName}`

There are three types of Db2 DataSource definition that can be used in CICS Liberty, all use the same Db2 JDBC driver (JCC) but have slightly different transactional behaviours. They are as follows:
- The original `cicsts_dataSource` using type 2 connectivity and a CICS DB2CONN resource.
- A Liberty `dataSource` with type 2 connectivity and a CICS DB2CONN resource.
- A Liberty `dataSource` with type 4 connectivity and using remote TCP/IP connection managed by Liberty. 

When using the default transactional scope of the CICS unit-of-work with a T2 Liberty JDBC connection you may notice that methods in the sample that perform data base updates will rollback by default (and therefore also rollback the CICS UOW). This is because the JdbcTemplate **closes** connections after usage. Closing a connection will cause the Liberty connection factory to *cleanup* outstanding requests if they are not autocommited, and are not in a global transaction. Since the default Liberty dataSource setting for the `commitOrRollbackOnCleanup`](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS7K4U_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.liberty.autogen.zos.doc/ae/rwlp_config_dataSource.html) property is `rollback` and autocommit is not supported for T2 connections then requests to a T2 JDBC connection that use a Liberty dataSource will rollback by default unless the property is set to commit. This does not apply to the cicsts_dataSource as this does not use the Liberty data source connection manager, and by default does not apply to T4 JDBC connections, since T4 JDBC connections default to using JDBC autocommit, which means every individual JDBC request will be auto-committed after usage. The following table summarises the different commit behaviours for each typee of data source ous


|data source      |type     |autocommit    |autocommit default  |Default commit behaviour|
|-----------------|---------|--------------|--------------------|---------------------------------|
|cicsts_dataSource  |T2     |false         |false               |commit CICS UOW   |
|Liberty datasource |T2     |false         |false               |rollback CICS UOW   |
|Liberty dataSource |T4     |true or false |true                |commit database udpate     |

To avoid this situation a global transactional scope can be used to control the transactional scope of all updates. Our sample provides a set of transactional service endpoint such as `/addEmployeeTx`. These map to service methods that create a global transaction using the Spring `@Transactional` annotation as shown below. This ensures all the work called from this method is part of a single global transaction coordinated by Libety. This includes the CICS UOW and resource it controls such as JDBC type 2 connections, and any requests to Liberty managed resources such as JDBC type 4 connections. 

```java
    @GetMapping("/addEmployeeTx/{firstName}/{lastName}")
    @ResponseBody
    @Transactional
    public String addEmpTx(@PathVariable String firstName , @PathVariable String lastName) 
    {
        String result = employeeService.addEmployee(firstName,lastName);
        return result;
    }
```

For further details on using Spring Transactions within CICS refer to the previous tutorial [Spring Boot Java applications for CICS, Part 3: Transactions](https://github.com/cicsdev/cics-java-liberty-springboot-transactions/blob/master/blog/Blog.md)

> **Note:** In addition if application security is enabled in the target Liberty server, you will also need to enable an authentication method, and authorisation roles. To do this you will need to create a Jave EE `web.xml file`, and place this in the src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/ folder. A sample `web.xml` file that supports basic authentication is provided in the associated Git repository. For further details on enabling security refer to the previous tutorial [Spring Boot Java applications for CICS, Part 2: Security](https://developer.ibm.com/technologies/spring/tutorials/spring-boot-java-applications-for-cics-part-2-security/)

## Step 5 : Running the sample

To deploy the sample into a CICS Liberty JVM server, you need to first build the application as a WAR. Gradle [build.gradle](https://github.com/cicsdev/cics-java-liberty-springboot-jdbc/build.gradle) and Maven [pom.xml](https://github.com/cicsdev/cics-java-liberty-springboot-jdbc/pom.xml) files are provided in the sample Git repository to simplify this task. You will then need to deploy the WAR into a CICS Liberty JVM server. There are a couple of ways of doing this, by either:

- Adding an <application> element to the Liberty server.xml that points directly to the WAR
- Adding the WAR to a CICS bundle project, export this to CICS, and install using a CICS BUNDLE resource definition

Further instructions on deploying the sample to CICS and creating the required `dataSource` definitions can be found in the Git repository [README](https://github.com/cicsdev/cics-java-liberty-springboot-jdbc/blob/master/README.md)

To invoke the application you can use the following example URL
   `http://myzos.mycompany.com:httpPort/cics-java-liberty-springboot-jdbc-0.1.0/`
  
This will return a response which looks similar to the following which lists the different services available.

### Deploy the WAR into a CICS Liberty JVM server
There are two ways to deploy the WAR. 
1. You can add an <application> element to your server.xml which points to your uploaded WAR file location.
2. You can deploy the Spring Boot WAR as a WAR bundlepart within a CICS bundle.
  
Both methods are described in [Spring Boot Java applications for CICS, Part 1: JCICS, Gradle, and Maven](https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/spring-boot-java-applications-for-cics-part-1-jcics-maven-gradle/


### Add Datasource defintion to server.xml

The server.xml requires a datasource defintion to enable the connection to DB2. Either JDBC type 2 connectivity, or JDBC type 4 connectivity can be used:

### Type 4
An example of a DataSource using type 4 connectivity follows:

```xml
  <dataSource id="t4"  jndiName="jdbc/jdbcDataSource" type="javax.sql.DataSource">
         <jdbcDriver libraryRef="db2Lib"/>
        <properties.db2.jcc currentSchema="DSN81110" databaseName="DSNV11P2" driverType="4" password="+++++++++++++"
                      portNumber="<port num>" serverName="<your server name>" user="<user id"/>
  </dataSource>
 
  <library id="db2Lib">
        <fileset dir="/usr/lpp/db2v11/jdbc/classes" includes="db2jcc4.jar db2jcc_license_cisuz.jar"/>
        <fileset dir="/usr/lpp/db2v11/jdbc/lib"/>
   </library>
```

A DataSource using JDBC type 4 connectivity does not require CICS to have an installed DB2CONN definition.

### Type 2
An example of a DataSource using JDBC type 2 connectivity follows:

```xml
   <dataSource id="t2" jndiName="jdbc/jdbcDataSource" transactional="false">
        <jdbcDriver libraryRef="db2Lib"/>
        <properties.db2.jcc currentSchema="DSN81110" driverType="2"/>
        <connectionManager agedTimeout="0"/>
   </dataSource>
   
   <library id="db2Lib">
        <fileset dir="/usr/lpp/db2v11/jdbc/classes" includes="db2jcc4.jar db2jcc_license_cisuz.jar"/>
        <fileset dir="/usr/lpp/db2v11/jdbc/lib"/>
   </library>
```

For JDBC type 2 connectivity to Db2, an active CICS DB2CONN resource must be installed and available in the CICS region. 

## Transactional Discussion

There are three types of Db2 DataSource definition that can be used in CICS Liberty, all use the Db2 JDBC driver (JCC). They are:
- the original `cicsts_dataSource` using type 2 connectivity (DB2CONN) and supporting driver manager
- a Liberty `dataSource` with type 2 connectivity (using CICS DB2CONN for connection management)
- a Liberty `dataSource` with type 4 connectivity (using TCP/IP and Liberty for connection management)

DataSources are defined in server.xml, and JNDI is used by this application to autowire to the specified DataSource given by the URL in `application.properties`.   
It is important to note that when the Db2 JDBC driver is operating in a CICS environment with type 2 connectivity, the autocommit property is <i>forced</i> to 'false' and by default the `commitOrRollbackOnCleanup` property is set to 'rollback'. Traditionally this has been because the driver defers to CICS UOW processing to demark transactions in a CICS application. Conversely, JDBC type 4 connectivity defaults to 'autocommit=true' as this is more standard in a distributed environment. Additionally the `commitOrRollbackOnCleanup` property does <b>not</b> apply if autocommit is on, AND autocommit does not apply if using a global txn.

The differing values of these properties for different DataSource types, give rise to different transactional behaviour when used in CICS Liberty. For example, calling the `/addEmployee` endpoint in this sample with a Liberty type 4 DataSource will result in an automatic commit, the same call using a Liberty type 2 DataSource will result in rollback, because autocommit=false (is forced by JCC driver) and the clean-up behaviour (if there is no explicit transaction) is to rollback.

For the `cicsts_dataSource` which uses type 2 connectivity, the behaviour is similar to Liberty type 4 but this DataSource implementation does not involve the Liberty transaction manager by default and so the clean-up behaviour does not apply. Thus when the transaction finishes, CICS will implicitly commit the UOW, and the database updates are committed. 

You can emulate the autocommit behaviour for a Liberty DataSource with type 2 connectivity by setting the `commitOrRollbackOnCleanUp` property to 'commit'. However, should the application then cause an exception or abend, the CICS UOW containing the Db2 update has already been committed and only a second new (empty) UOW is rolled back.

Thus, for each update operation in this sample we provide a second end-point version (post-fix 'Tx') which wraps the call in an XA (global) transaction and in all environments the behaviour remains fully transactional and consistent. You can observe the differences in behaviour by defining different DataSource types in your server.xml and driving the different local vs global transaction endpoints.

For more details about using the @Transactional annotation and XA transactions see [Spring Boot Java applications for CICS - Part 3 - Transactions](https://github.com/cicsdev/cics-java-liberty-springboot-transactions/blob/master/blog/Blog.md)

## Summary
Using JDBC to access relataional database is made easy in Spring using the JdbcTemplate. After completing this tutorial, you should be able to start to build fully functional Java based business applications in CICS using Spring Boot.
